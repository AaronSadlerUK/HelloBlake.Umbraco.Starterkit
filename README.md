# HelloBlake Umbraco Starterkit

The HelloBlake Umbraco Starterkit is meant to help you get a jump start on building Umbraco projects with the Bootstrap framework. The styles are not fully customized initialy so that you can implement your own themeing. Functionality has been setup to get these basic things working and configurable from within the Umbraco CMS. 

Documentation and guides for this starterkit are also in the works.

## Installation Instructions

Copy the [github repo](https://github.com/bkclerke/HelloBlake.Umbraco.Starterkit) for this project.

The super secret username and password for backoffice access is admin@admin.com and 0123456789.

I also recommend changing your passwords. ;)
